	<h2>Chizinski lab home </h2>
	
	<p> Welcome. This is the website for the lab group of Dr. Christopher Chizinski in the 
	<a href="http://snr.unl.edu/">School of Natural Resources</a> at <a href="http://www.unl.edu/">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>. Here you will find information on the people in the lab,
	current research projects, lab news, and my R notes.  </p>

	<p>We use a variety of approaches to study the interactions between social and ecological systems, with an emphasis
	on recreationally exploited systems. Our work combines stated and revealed behavior of sportspersons, ecological and behavior responses
	of exploited organisms, and quantitative approaches such as simulation models and network analysis.  </p>
