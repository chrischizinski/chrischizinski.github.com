<h2>Interested in joining the lab?</h2>	
<p>Welcome to our lab webpage. We are always working to build a rigorous and dynamic research program that 
	incorporates volunteers, technicians, and students. If you are interested in research in human dimensions 
	of wildlife management and social-ecological systems and find the research of the lab interesting consider 
	dropping me an email.  Generally, in the 
	<a href="http://snr.unl.edu/">School of Natural Resources</a> students are supported by Research Assistantships 
	funded through external grants.  These positions are limited and highly competitive.  If you are interested in working 
	in our lab feel free to send me information about yourself including: personal letter about your interests, statement of 
	professional goals, emails addresses of references, GRE scores, transcripts, and CV. 
	Also check out SNR's <a href="http://snr.unl.edu/gradstudent/">graduate program</a> 
	including the <a href="http://snr.unl.edu/gradstudent/entrancerequirements.asp">entrance requirements</a> 
	and <a href="http://snr.unl.edu/gradstudent/applicationprocess.asp">application procedures</a> for the MS and PhD programs.<p>
