#Alexis Fedele

##MS Student – Applied Ecology 

##Background:
I grew up in Northern California, and from an early age, had a broad interest in wildlife and the outdoors. These interests narrowed after my first undergraduate technician position assisting with a study of endangered giant kangaroo rats, when I became intrigued by community interactions in an ecosystem and animal behavior. I chose to work with two non-profits promoting aquatic ecosystem restoration for two years to gain experience before deciding to pursue a Master’s degree at UNL. 

##Research:
I am interested in human dimensions of wildlife, behavioral reaction norms, and phenotypic plasticity in animal behavior. Specifically, I am focusing on fishes’ behavioral response to angling. Using laboratory experiments, I am exploring whether fish are able to learn to alter their behavior after repeated fishing events and whether their ability to learn is affected by their individual level of boldness. 

##Education: 
* B.S. Molecular Environmental Biology with an emphasis in Animal Behavior, UC Berkeley (2012)
