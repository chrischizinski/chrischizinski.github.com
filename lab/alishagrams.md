## Alisha Grams - MS Student – Applied Ecology 

## Background:
I grew up in Southern Minnesota with a passion for being outdoors, specifically fishing and hiking. I pursued my interests in nature by exploring a diverse range of college courses and taking on an undergraduate research project that focused on the behavior of crayfish under different environmental conditions. I spent two summer seasons as an interpreter for two state parks, 
which broadened my knowledge of many wildlife and human interaction topics. In addition, I worked with the Minnesota 
Department of Natural Resources as a watercraft inspector, which gave me insight as to how the public views and responds 
to natural resource laws and regulations. 

## Research:
My interests include restoration ecology, human interactions and invasive species, and plant and wildlife community interactions. 
More specifically, I am examining hunter’s response to regulations involving big game hunting.  

## Education: 
* B.S. Natural Resources with emphases in Ecological Restoration, Park Management, and Natural Resource Management and a Biology minor, UM-Crookston (2015)
