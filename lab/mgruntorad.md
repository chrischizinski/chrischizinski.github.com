##Matthew Gruntorad - Research Program Coordinator

##Background:
I grew up on a small farm here in Nebraska, where  I enjoyed all of the outdoor recreation opportunities that rural living has to offer. As an undergraduate, I assisted in research involving capture rates of catfish in Nebraska’s lakes and river systems. As a master’s student at Texas Tech University, I investigated the potential for using sound produced by gizzard shad as a means to evaluate water conditions. After completing my master’s work, I returned to Nebraska to work for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, where I operated the Family Fishing Program and participated in Aquatic Education.

##Research:
My work at the University of Nebraska centers on Human Dimensions of Wildlife Management. My greatest concern is for the preservation of fishing and hunting resources for the youth of tomorrow. Additionally, I aim to better understand how today’s hunters and anglers take advantage of the outdoor opportunities available to them.
