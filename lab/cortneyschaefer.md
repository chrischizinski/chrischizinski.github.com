## Cortney Schaefer - Ph.D. Student – Human Dimensions

## Background:

I grew up in south-central Nebraska.  I always enjoyed hunting and the outdoors.  In high school, I started leading tours to see migrating Sandhill Cranes and other waterfowl.  I knew that I would always work in the wildlife field after that.  During my undergrad at the University of Wyoming, I gained a lot of experience working with invasive species (Sea Lamprey in Lake Huron), gamebirds (Sage Grouse in central Wyoming), and Chronic Wasting Disease (raising deer fawns for the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory).  And while I enjoyed each of these projects, I began to realize that there was a real disconnect between the work that wildlife biologists do and the public’s understanding of its significance. 

After a brief period of working with an endangered species of Pronghorn, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Environmental Education and Interpretation at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.  I feel that public support and interest in wildlife is an integral part of wildlife management.  My research project focused on developing a community education plan for urban white-tailed deer management.  I learned a lot while working with the public to resolve the complex issues involved with a controversial species in an urban setting.

After completing my master’s degree, I worked as a Wildlife Biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for over seven years.  During my time with the DNR, I conducted many wildlife surveys and completed many habitat improvement projects.  I continued to work with municipalities on urban deer issues, as well as expanding into other nuisance wildlife issues (farmers with crop damage, farmers with wolf depredations, etc.).  Having always been an avid hunter, I also became more and more involved with hunter recruitment and retention efforts.  I raise, train, judge, and hunt with German gundogs so I was very interested in combining my personal and professional interests.  I started coordinating several Learn to Hunt workshops to introduce novice hunters to pursuing different game species.  I served on a few statewide committees aimed at recruiting more hunters in Wisconsin.  

My husband and I moved to Nebraska to be closer to family in July 2015.  With the move, I began to consider other career options.  While I enjoyed working as a Wildlife Biologist, I was eager to explore other opportunities that might focus more on the topics I was most interested in.  When I saw a doctorate position offered through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln that was aimed entirely at waterfowl hunter recruitment, retention, and reactivation, I knew that I had to pursue it.  After years of only getting to allocate a portion of my time towards R3 efforts, I am thrilled to finally get to dedicate 100% of my time towards keeping the tradition of waterfowl hunting alive and well.

## Research interests:

I believe that the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation is truly a national treasure. The driving principal behind the model is that wildlife belongs to the people. So we all have a responsibility to understand how to conserve wildlife species and maintain a healthy ecosystem.  I believe that conservation education is just as important as habitat management. As a former wildlife manager, I consider it my responsibility to engage and inform the public to build support for and interest in wildlife management objectives.  And an important component to achieving those objectives is maintaining a healthy population of hunters and trappers.

I would like the opportunity to continue researching new and more effective ways to recruit/retain/reactivate hunters. With funding sources for wildlife management dwindling, I feel this is an extremely important endeavor. I am also very interested in pursuing research on how to better communicate wildlife management goals to the public. Since most of the state of Nebraska resides in private ownership, it is vital that we collaborate with landowners to improve habitat management.
