#### R
I have been contemplating starting up a blog, particularly one that I could share things I find interesting and as a repository for some of the tricks and techniques I use in [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
If you are interested in learning about me you can step on over to [About Me](/about.html) and see my publications and research interests.  

I started messing around with R back when I was working on my dissertation down at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu) but at the time I never really embraced it.   At the time, I was primarily using Matlab for modelling and multivariate 
stats and then SAS for general statistics work.  When I started a postdoc up at the [University of Minnesota](http://www.umn.edu), I lost my access to Matlab and did not really want to purchase it.  So
I committed self to learning R and since then I never looked back. I love that under a single environment you have the ability to

* construct population models
* develop functions and procedures
* work with shapefiles
* use almost any statistical procedure
* construct publication and presentation quality graphs

I hope to share some of these tricks and techniques that I have come across working on some of these things but also some of the new things I come across.  I am always open to improving the 
efficiency of my code, so if you have suggestions please pass them along.  


#### This blog 
When I started thinking about this blog, I was trying to figure out what was the best way to accomplish it and getting it hosted (the freer the better).  When I was researching how 
to go about this I stumbled on a few blogs that had developed their blogs using [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
Developing a site in this manner allowed for simple, easily customizable sites and could incorporate R code using [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and *RMarkdown*. 

Two posts that were instrumental in me
getting this off and running could be found at [jfisher-usgs](http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/lessons/2012/05/30/jekyll-build-on-windows/) 
and [Fellgernon Bit](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/11/09/new-Fellgernon-Bit-setup-in-Github/#.Uzx0YPldVEK).   Please visit these sites for info on setting up a Jekyll blog in Github.
