We are always working to build a rigorous and dynamic research program that incorporates volunteers, technicians, and students. We involve students in research to provide hands-on training, inspire enthusiasm for understanding the natural world, and provide guidance 
towards conducting strong inference science.  We favor guidance in the form of helping students to think, rather than providing our opinion 
of the “answers”.  We view students as autonomous researchers and collaborators, and encourage them to pursue questions that are not 
necessarily in line with our own research because we believe diversity in questions and projects adds depth and interest to a research group.  We encourage hard work, creativity, and perseverance from our students, and expect students to be responsible for their own education, while 
we strive to tailor our mentoring style to their individual needs, character, and understanding.


If you are interested in the interactions between sportspersons and wildlife and find the research of the lab interesting consider dropping me an email.
In the [School of Natural Resources](http://snr.unl.edu/) students are supported by Research Assistantships funded through external grants.  These positions are limited and highly competitive.  If you are interested in working in our lab feel free to send me information about 
yourself including: personal letter about your interests, statement of of professional goals, emails addresses of references, GRE scores, transcripts, and CV.
